  # Set minimum and maximum number of instances of the application. 
  # If the minimum and maximum values are different, the service scales the
  # instances up and down based on the CPU utilization.
  instances:
    # The minimum number of instances. Must be at least 1. For 
    # high-availability support, set this value to at least 3. The service
    # spreads instances among different availability zones. 
    # Defaults to 1 if not set.
    min: 1
    
    # The maximum number of instances. Cannot be less than the min value. 
    # Defaults to the min value if not set.
    max: 1
    
  # Configure vCPU and indirectly memory resources for the application. 
  # The memory assigned to the application is directly proportional to the 
  # requested vCPU number multiplied by 4. For example, if cpu is set to 1, 4Gi
  # memory is allocated to the application; if cpu is set to 2, 8Gi of memory
  # is allocated to the application; and so on.  
  resources:
    # The vCPU number for the application. If not set, it defaults to 1 vCPU. 
    # The max number of vCPU that can be requested is 14.
    cpu: 1

  # Set a list of environment variables for the application. Environment 
  # variables such as JVM_ARGS, JAVA_HOME, or any WLP_* environment variables

  # Set the Java runtime version for the application. Set to 8 for IBM Java 8,
  # 17 for IBM Semeru 17, or 21 for IBM Semeru 21. If not set, the service
  # tries to automatically detect the Java version for the application. If the

  # Set a list of service bindings for the application. The bindings can be
  # provided in two ways: by providing the full crn value of the service 
  # instance or by providing the name and type of the service instance. The
  # preferred way is to provide the crn value as the service instance names
  # can change and might not be unique.
